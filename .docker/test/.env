# This is a sample .env file for use in local development.
# When the new images are built, have your continuous deployment system deploy them to a staging environment.

# Product environment
# If you want to run it in a test environment, you should use the "test" tag.
# For Alpine Linux:
#   APP_ENV="test"
APP_ENV="test"
# A unique name for your app
APP_NAME="web_service_template_flutter_dart"

# Docker Compose use environment variable
COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME="${APP_NAME}_${APP_ENV}"

# build
# If you need modifications, you can use an Alpine-based image.
# Set the distribution identifier and base image accordingly.
# For Alpine Linux:
#   DISTRIB_ID="alpine"
#   BASE_IMAGE="alpine:latest"
#
# For Debian-based systems:
DISTRIB_ID="debian"
BASE_IMAGE="ubuntu"

# Physical or other resource addresses where you want the application to run

# DEPLOY
# You can perform performance testing by selecting lower resources in test environments.
